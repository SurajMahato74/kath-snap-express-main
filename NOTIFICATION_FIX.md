# Notification System Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **User-side notifications not working**: The user Header component wasn't connected to the notification system
2. **WebSocket connection failures**: Authentication middleware needed for token-based WebSocket connections
3. **Server configuration**: Need to ensure Django Channels server is running properly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated User Header Component
- Added notification functionality to `src/components/Header.tsx`
- Connected to notification service with proper state management
- Added dropdown with notification list and actions

### 2. Created User Notification Hook
- Created `src/hooks/useUserNotifications.ts` for polling-based notifications
- Provides fallback when WebSocket connections fail
- Handles notification loading, marking as read, etc.

### 3. Fixed WebSocket Authentication
- Created `backend/ezeyway/accounts/websocket_auth.py` for token-based WebSocket auth
- Updated `backend/ezeyway/ezeyway/asgi.py` to use custom auth middleware
- Improved error handling in WebSocket connection

### 4. Created Notifications Page
- Added `src/pages/Notifications.tsx` for full notification management
- Users can view all notifications, mark as read, etc.

## How to Test

### 1. Start Redis Server
```bash
# Make sure Redis is running (you already have it running)
# Redis should be available at localhost:6379
```

### 2. Start Django Server with WebSocket Support
```bash
cd backend/ezeyway
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

### 3. Test Notifications

#### For Users (Customer Side):
1. Open the app and click the notification bell icon in the header
2. You should see a dropdown with notifications
3. Navigate to `/notifications` to see the full notifications page

#### For Vendors:
1. The vendor notifications should already be working
2. Test by placing an order from the customer side

### 4. Verify WebSocket Connection
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check the Console tab for WebSocket connection logs
3. Should see: "Notification WebSocket connected" if successful
4. If WebSocket fails, the system will fall back to polling every 10 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues
If you see "WebSocket connection failed" errors:

1. **Check if Django Channels is installed**:
   ```bash
   pip install channels channels-redis
   ```

2. **Verify Redis is running**:
   ```bash
   redis-cli ping
   # Should return "PONG"
   ```

3. **Check Django settings**:
   - Ensure `channels` is in `INSTALLED_APPS`
   - Verify `CHANNEL_LAYERS` configuration in settings.py

4. **Use polling fallback**:
   - The system automatically falls back to API polling if WebSocket fails
   - Notifications will still work, just with a slight delay (10-second intervals)

### No Notifications Appearing
1. **Check authentication**: Make sure user is logged in with valid token
2. **Verify API endpoints**: Test `/api/notifications/` endpoint manually
3. **Check backend logs**: Look for any errors in Django console

### Backend Server Issues
1. **Use the startup script**:
   ```bash
   python backend/start_server.py
   ```

2. **Manual startup**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/ezeyway
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver 8000
   ```

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend Files Modified:
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Added notification functionality
- `src/hooks/useNotificationWebSocket.ts` - Improved error handling
- `src/hooks/useUserNotifications.ts` - New polling-based hook
- `src/pages/Notifications.tsx` - New notifications page

### Backend Files Modified:
- `backend/ezeyway/accounts/websocket_auth.py` - New WebSocket auth middleware
- `backend/ezeyway/ezeyway/asgi.py` - Updated to use token auth
- `backend/start_server.py` - New server startup script

## Expected Behavior

### User Side:
1. Notification bell icon shows unread count
2. Clicking bell opens dropdown with recent notifications
3. Notifications are marked as read when clicked
4. Full notifications page available at `/notifications`

### Vendor Side:
1. Should continue working as before
2. Real-time notifications for new orders
3. WebSocket connection with fallback to polling

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes**: Try the notification system on both user and vendor sides
2. **Monitor WebSocket**: Check if WebSocket connections are stable
3. **Add notification routes**: Ensure `/notifications` route is added to your router
4. **Customize styling**: Adjust notification appearance as needed

The notification system should now work for both users and vendors, with proper fallback mechanisms in case of connection issues.
